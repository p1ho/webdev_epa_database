How to update:

- go to and download "database/summary_database_macro.xlsm"
- Open and Enable Macros
- Update the entries
- Click "Export to JSON Format"
- *Optional* Back up server file ("summary_database.json" and "summary_database_macro")
- Overwrite server file
- Done!

Note:

- I only created 1 column for PDF, so if you come across a paper with 2 pdf's (main paper + appendix... etc), I would advise combining them into a single pdf.

- the Macro is smart enough to take care of additional PPT files, so if there is an entry with more than 4 ppt's, you can add a column yourself and name it "PPT-5" and so on
